Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: All three model architectures correctly classified the images as `bernese mountain` dog.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: The ResNet model architecture was wrong, it classified Dog_02.jpg as a `border collie`. AlexNet and VVGNet were correct and classified also Dog_02.jpg as a `bernese mountain£ dog.


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: Yes, all three model architectures correctly classified these images as not dogs.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: Based on my answers for question 1 - 3 there is no difference between AlexNet and VGGNet, both did equally good (1 Second for 100%). But I 'feel' that VVGNet is the best model architecture for this task (based on the data of the 40 images, it had the highest score in on breeds).
